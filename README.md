# Powerless
Small game, made for Ludum Dare 38

## Description

Short puzzle game. Robot realizes himself on a tiny asteroid without any ideas about his purpose. Looks like there is a machine, somehow related to him, but it lacks energy. Probably fixing it will help somehow?

The puzzle is really very short (takes 2-10 min to complete), but still.  

## Controls

Hold right mouse button to move, click left mouse button to interact.

## Warning

The code was written in a bit mor than a day, and makes me feel guilty about it's quality. You better not to see it :D
